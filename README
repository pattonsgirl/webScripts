master-usergen contains user generation scripts
Course specific names are used as functions

Required:
index.html - this can be blank, but basically a default folder to put in each dir.  
  Not necessary, but script does use it, and I use it to test things are working
namefile.txt - can be any name - need to pass to user creator
pwgen - apt-get install for ubuntu
instructor account - needs to already be on the system

Notes:
Instructor username and password needs to be modified in the script to let them access student files and website
Adds htaccess and htpasswd in directory html to lock down who can access a page (is set to just instructor and student)
SFTP access is resricted to student and instructor


Output:
Text file with usernames and passwords separately by " - "
